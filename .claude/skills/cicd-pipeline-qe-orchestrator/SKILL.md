2. **Selects optimal QE skills** from the 37 available skills based on phase requirements
3. **Orchestrates specialized agents** from the 18 QE agents for parallel execution
4. **Ensures holistic coverage** with shift-left, shift-right, and continuous quality validation
5. **Adapts strategies** based on risk, complexity, and deployment environment

## Adaptive Strategy Selection

The orchestrator adapts based on:

### Risk Level
- **Critical**: Use all phases, maximum coverage, manual gates
- **High**: Use automated gates, comprehensive testing
- **Medium**: Use smart test selection, risk-based prioritization
- **Low**: Use minimal regression suite, fast feedback

### Application Type
- **API**: Focus on contract-testing, api-testing-patterns, performance-testing
- **Web UI**: Focus on visual-testing-advanced, accessibility-testing, compatibility-testing
- **Mobile**: Focus on mobile-testing, performance-testing, compatibility-testing
- **Backend**: Focus on database-testing, performance-testing, security-testing

### Deployment Frequency
- **Continuous (hourly)**: Minimal regression, fast feedback, shift-right monitoring
- **Daily**: Smart test selection, parallel execution, automated gates
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive testing, exploratory sessions, manual validation
- **Monthly**: Full regression, compliance checks, extensive validation

## Integration with Existing QE Fleet

### Memory Coordination

All agents coordinate through the `aqe/*` namespace:

```
aqe/
├── pipeline/
│   ├── phase-results/          # Results from each phase
│   ├── quality-gates/          # Gate validation results
│   └── orchestration-plan/     # Selected skills and agents
├── test-plan/generated         # Test plans from generators
├── coverage/gaps               # Coverage analysis results
├── security/findings           # Security scan results
└── performance/results         # Performance test results
```

### Skill Invocation

Invoke individual QE skills as needed:

```javascript
// Use specific QE skills
Skill("shift-left-testing")      // Learn shift-left practices
Skill("chaos-engineering-resilience") // Apply chaos engineering
Skill("api-testing-patterns")    // Implement API testing
```

### Agent Coordination

Use the `qe-fleet-commander` for complex multi-agent orchestration:

```javascript
Task("Fleet Orchestration",
     "Coordinate 10 agents across pipeline phases: commit (2 agents), build (3 agents), test (3 agents), staging (2 agents)",
     "qe-fleet-commander")
```

---

## Quality Gates Configuration

### Gate Templates

**Commit Gate**:
```json
{
  "phase": "commit",
  "gates": [
    { "metric": "unit_coverage", "threshold": 80, "blocking": true },
    { "metric": "static_analysis", "severity": "critical", "max_violations": 0 },
    { "metric": "code_review", "status": "approved", "blocking": true }
  ]
}
```

**Build Gate**:
```json
{
  "phase": "build",
  "gates": [
    { "metric": "all_tests_passed", "threshold": 100, "blocking": true },
    { "metric": "coverage", "threshold": 90, "blocking": true },
    { "metric": "mutation_score", "threshold": 70, "blocking": false }
  ]
}
```

**Integration Gate**:
```json
{
  "phase": "integration",
  "gates": [
    { "metric": "api_contracts", "breaking_changes": 0, "blocking": true },
    { "metric": "performance_p95", "threshold_ms": 200, "blocking": true },
    { "metric": "security_critical", "max_vulnerabilities": 0, "blocking": true }
  ]
}
```

### Gate Execution

```javascript
// Validate quality gates
Task("Quality Gate Validation",
     "Validate all gates for integration phase: API contracts, performance SLAs, security scans",
     "qe-quality-gate")
```

---

## Advanced Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Phase Execution

```javascript
// Execute multiple phases in parallel (for microservices)
Task("Service A Pipeline", "Run full pipeline for service A", "qe-fleet-commander")
Task("Service B Pipeline", "Run full pipeline for service B", "qe-fleet-commander")
Task("Service C Pipeline", "Run full pipeline for service C", "qe-fleet-commander")
```

### Pattern 2: Sequential with Gates

```javascript
// Sequential execution with quality gates
Task("Commit Phase", "Shift-left testing and validation", "qe-test-generator")
// Check gate before proceeding
Task("Build Phase", "Run tests if commit gate passes", "qe-test-executor")
// Check gate before proceeding
Task("Integration Phase", "API and performance tests if build gate passes", "qe-api-contract-validator")
```

### Pattern 3: Adaptive Selection

```javascript
// Adaptive strategy based on code changes
Task("Risk Analysis", "Analyze code changes and select minimal test suite", "qe-regression-risk-analyzer")
// Execute only selected tests
Task("Targeted Testing", "Run minimal test suite based on risk analysis", "qe-test-executor")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many Tests Running (OOM)

**Symptoms**: Build fails with out-of-memory errors
**Cause**: Running all tests in parallel without batching
**Solution**: Use batched execution

```javascript
// Use batched test execution
Task("Batched Tests", "Run tests in batches of 10 with memory limits", "qe-test-executor")
```

See [Test Execution Policy](https://github.com/ruvnet/agentic-qe-cf/blob/main/docs/policies/test-execution.md)

### Issue: Pipeline Takes Too Long

**Symptoms**: Pipeline exceeds time budget
**Cause**: Running comprehensive testing on every commit
**Solution**: Use smart test selection

```javascript
// Use regression risk analysis
Task("Smart Selection", "Select minimal test suite based on code changes", "qe-regression-risk-analyzer")
```

### Issue: Quality Gates Failing

**Symptoms**: Deployment blocked by quality gates
**Cause**: Thresholds too strict or tests not comprehensive
**Solution**: Review and adjust gates

```javascript
// Analyze quality metrics
Task("Quality Analysis", "Analyze trends and recommend threshold adjustments", "qe-quality-analyzer")
```
