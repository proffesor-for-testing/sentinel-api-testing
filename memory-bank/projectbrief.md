# Project Brief: Sentinel - AI Agentic API Testing Platform

## 1. Project Overview

**Sentinel** is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed to automate the entire API testing lifecycle. It leverages a modular, microservices-inspired architecture and an ecosystem of specialized, ephemeral AI agents to provide comprehensive, intelligent, and efficient testing across functional, security, and performance domains.

The platform is built upon the **ruv-FANN** and **ruv-swarm** frameworks, enabling a paradigm of "ephemeral swarm intelligence" where lightweight, WASM-based agents are dynamically spawned to perform specific testing tasks and dissolved upon completion.

## 2. Core Objective

The primary goal of Sentinel is to create a sophisticated, end-to-end testing solution that transforms the API development and quality assurance process. It aims to move beyond traditional test automation by empowering expert SDETs with a collaborative tool that can:

- **Intelligently generate** comprehensive test suites from API specifications.
- **Automate** complex testing scenarios, including stateful workflows and security vulnerabilities.
- **Provide deep insights** through advanced analytics and historical trend analysis.
- **Seamlessly integrate** into modern CI/CD pipelines.
- **Improve API quality** by providing actionable feedback throughout the development lifecycle.

## 3. Key Features & Scope

The platform's scope encompasses the following key feature sets:

- **Specification Intelligence:** Ingest, parse, validate, and analyze OpenAPI specifications to assess their quality and "LLM-readiness."
- **Agentic Test Generation:** A workforce of specialized agents for:
    - **Functional Testing:** Positive, negative, boundary, and stateful scenario generation.
    - **Security Testing:** Probing for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (API & LLM), including BOLA, prompt injection, and SSRF.
    - **Performance Testing:** Automated generation of test plans and AI-powered analysis of results.
- **Test Orchestration & Execution:** A central hub to manage the agentic workflow, schedule test runs, and execute tests in parallel.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** A rich, interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring, detailed run reports, and performance visualizations.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Historical trend analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive quality insights.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Seamless integration with platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Test case management, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and shared dashboards.

## 4. Target Audience

The primary users of the Sentinel platform are:

- **Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs):** Who will use the platform to design, automate, and analyze complex testing strategies.
- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers:** Who will leverage the platform to execute regression suites and validate API functionality.
- **Developers:** Who can use the platform for early-stage testing and to receive rapid feedback on their code.
- **DevOps Engineers:** Who will integrate Sentinel into CI/CD pipelines to enable continuous testing.

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of the Sentinel project will be measured by:

- **Reduction in Time-to-Market:** Faster feedback loops and automated testing cycles.
- **Improved API Quality:** Reduction in production bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- **Increased Test Coverage:** Generation of more comprehensive and diverse test suites than manual efforts.
- **Enhanced Developer Productivity:** Freeing up engineering time from manual test creation and analysis.
- **High User Adoption:** Positive feedback and active use by the target audience.
