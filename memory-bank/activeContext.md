    -   âœ… **Factory Pattern Implementation:** All services refactored with factory pattern for enhanced testability
    -   âœ… **Comprehensive Test Suites:** 224 tests with 97.8% pass rate (219/224 passing)
    -   âœ… **Smart Rust Integration Tests:** Environment-aware tests that skip when service unavailable
    -   âœ… **LLM Test Suite Fixed:** Created concrete TestAgent class for proper base agent testing

    -   **Minor Remaining Issues (2 tests):**
        - 1 LLM integration test metadata assertion issue
        - 1 API Gateway health check mock configuration issue
        - Note: 3 Rust tests properly skip when service unavailable (by design)

2.  **Platform Evolution - Next Phase:**
    -   âœ… **Phase 3: Frontend & Community:** **COMPLETED**
        - âœ… Built Open-Source Community with comprehensive guidelines
        - âœ… Modernized Frontend Architecture with Redux Toolkit and React Query  
        - âœ… Implemented Complete Authentication System with JWT and React UI
    -   **Performance Benchmarking:**
        - Conduct comprehensive performance benchmark to quantify Rust implementation improvements
        - Compare latency, throughput, and resource utilization against previous Python-based system

3.  **Production Readiness Final Steps:**
    -   CI/CD pipeline integration with automated testing
    -   Security audit and penetration testing
    -   Disaster recovery planning and testing
    -   Production deployment runbook and automation

4.  **Platform Enhancements:**
    -   Advanced user management features (password reset, user invitations)
    -   Enhanced role-based permissions with granular controls
    -   Real-time notifications and dashboard updates
    -   API rate limiting and advanced security features

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Once the core agents are ported, a performance benchmark should be conducted to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Further work is needed to enhance error handling and resilience in the communication between the Python and Rust services.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensure that the ported Rust agents have full feature parity with the original Python implementations.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Rust Dependencies:** `actix-web` is used for the web server, `serde` for serialization, `async-trait` for the agent trait, and `lapin` for RabbitMQ integration.
- **Configuration:** The Orchestration Service uses a `RUST_CORE_URL` environment variable to locate the Rust service.
- **Code Structure:** The new Rust code is organized into `agents`, `types`, and `utils` modules within the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ handles asynchronous task distribution with durable queues for reliability.
