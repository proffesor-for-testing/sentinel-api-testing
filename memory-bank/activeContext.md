    - Add user management interface and access control middleware
    - Integrate RBAC with existing collaborative features

2.  **Documentation Finalization:**
    - Complete user documentation with tutorials and guides
    - Finalize technical documentation for deployment
    - Create API documentation for enterprise integration
    - Develop troubleshooting and maintenance guides

3.  **Advanced Analytics (Future Enhancement):**
    - Implement historical trend analysis service
    - Build advanced analytics dashboards
    - Add predictive quality insights and anomaly detection
    - Enhance reporting with machine learning insights

4.  **Production Readiness:**
    - Optimize performance and scalability
    - Add monitoring and observability features
    - Create deployment automation scripts
    - Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Phase 4 Success:** All major Phase 4 components have been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive security and performance testing capabilities.
- **Agent Architecture Scalability:** The modular agent architecture has proven highly scalable, now supporting six different agent types across functional, security, and performance domains.
