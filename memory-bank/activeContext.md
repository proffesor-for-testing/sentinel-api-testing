## 3. Next Steps

With Phase 4 completed, the next steps focus on Phase 5 implementation:

1.  **Phase 5 Planning:**
    - Design CI/CD integration architecture for seamless pipeline integration
    - Plan intelligent data mocking agent for realistic test data generation
    - Research enterprise-grade features like RBAC and multi-tenancy

2.  **CI/CD Integration Development:**
    - Implement CLI tools for command-line test execution
    - Add webhook support for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins
    - Create pipeline configuration templates and examples

3.  **Enterprise Features:**
    - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
    - Add test case management UI with collaborative features
    - Build intelligent data mocking agent for dynamic test data

4.  **Advanced Analytics (Remaining):**
    - Implement historical trend analysis service
    - Build advanced analytics dashboards
    - Add predictive quality insights and anomaly detection

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Phase 4 Success:** All major Phase 4 components have been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive security and performance testing capabilities.
- **Agent Architecture Scalability:** The modular agent architecture has proven highly scalable, now supporting six different agent types across functional, security, and performance domains.
- **Security Testing Maturity:** The platform now provides enterprise-grade security testing with OWASP Top 10 coverage and LLM-specific vulnerability detection.
- **Performance Testing Integration:** k6 and JMeter script generation enables seamless integration with existing performance testing workflows.
- **Comprehensive Testing Coverage:** The platform now covers the full spectrum of API testing: functional, security, and performance.
- **LLM Provider:** An initial LLM provider needs to be selected for development and testing. OpenAI is a strong candidate due to its robust API and function-calling capabilities.
- **Enterprise Readiness:** Ready to begin Phase 5 focusing on enterprise features, CI/CD integration, and production deployment capabilities.
