# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

**ðŸš€ PLATFORM EVOLUTION IN PROGRESS!** The project is actively executing the `ruv-swarm` integration plan.

âœ… **`sentinel-rust-core` Service Created:** Foundational Rust service with `ruv-swarm` dependencies is in place.
ðŸ”¶ **Python Agents Ported to Rust (In Progress):**
  - âœ… `Functional-Positive-Agent` logic has been ported to Rust.
  - âœ… `Data-Mocking-Agent` logic has been ported to Rust.
  - â¬œ `Security-Auth-Agent` and other agents are next.
âœ… **Orchestration Service Updated:** The main orchestration service now has a hybrid mode to delegate tasks to either the new Rust core or the existing Python agents, ensuring a seamless transition.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Hybrid Execution Model:** The Orchestration Service can now intelligently route agent execution to either the high-performance Rust core or the legacy Python agents. This is controlled by the `USE_RUST_AGENTS` flag and runtime availability of the Rust service.
- **Rust Agent Architecture:** A new agent architecture has been implemented in the `sentinel-rust-core` service, including a base `Agent` trait, an `AgentOrchestrator`, and shared utilities.
- **REST API for Rust Core:** The `sentinel-rust-core` service exposes a REST API for agent orchestration (`/swarm/orchestrate`), health checks, and agent discovery.
- **Task Branching:** Development is now following the `task/port-python-agents-to-rust` branch, adhering to the project's branch management protocol.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Agent Porting:**
    -   Port the `Security-Auth-Agent` to Rust.
    -   Port the `Functional-Negative-Agent` and other remaining agents.
2.  **Integration Testing:**
    -   Thoroughly test the integration between the Python Orchestration Service and the Rust core.
    -   Validate that the test cases generated by the Rust agents are equivalent to their Python counterparts.
3.  **Production Readiness (Phase 2 of Evolution Plan):**
    -   Implement the observability stack (logging, metrics, tracing).
    -   Integrate a message broker for asynchronous communication.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Once the core agents are ported, a performance benchmark should be conducted to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Further work is needed to enhance error handling and resilience in the communication between the Python and Rust services.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensure that the ported Rust agents have full feature parity with the original Python implementations.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Rust Dependencies:** `actix-web` is used for the web server, `serde` for serialization, and `async-trait` for the agent trait.
- **Configuration:** The Orchestration Service uses a `RUST_CORE_URL` environment variable to locate the Rust service.
- **Code Structure:** The new Rust code is organized into `agents`, `types`, and `utils` modules within the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
