# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

**🚀 PLATFORM EVOLUTION: PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS!** The observability stack has been successfully implemented. The platform now has comprehensive monitoring and tracing capabilities.

✅ **Phase 1: `ruv-swarm` Integration & Core Refinement (COMPLETE):**
  - ✅ **`sentinel-rust-core` Service Created:** A new Rust-based microservice now serves as the high-performance agentic core.
  - ✅ **Python Agents Ported to Rust:** Core agent logic has been successfully migrated to Rust, leveraging the `ruv-swarm` framework.
  - ✅ **Orchestration Service Updated:** The Python backend is now fully decoupled from agent implementation, delegating tasks to the Rust core.
  - ✅ **Docker Environment Stabilized:** All services, including the new Rust core, are stable and integrated within the Docker environment.

🔄 **Phase 2: Production Readiness (IN PROGRESS):**
  - ✅ **Observability Stack Implemented:** Complete observability solution with structured logging (structlog), correlation ID tracking, Prometheus metrics, and Jaeger distributed tracing.
  - ✅ **Message Broker Integration:** COMPLETED - RabbitMQ integrated for asynchronous communication with durable queues.
  - ⬜ **Database & Security Standardization:** Pending - adopt alembic migrations and security headers.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Message Broker Integration Complete:** RabbitMQ successfully integrated:
  - RabbitMQ added to Docker Compose infrastructure
  - Message broker configuration added to centralized settings
  - Publisher implementation in Orchestration Service (`broker.py`)
  - Consumer implementation in Sentinel Rust Core with retry logic
  - Fixed type compatibility issues (spec_id: i32 → String)
  - Comprehensive test suite validates end-to-end message flow
  - Durable queues ensure message persistence across restarts

- **Observability Implementation Complete:** All Python services now have:
  - Structured JSON logging with `structlog` for better log aggregation and analysis
  - Correlation ID middleware for request tracking across services
  - Prometheus metrics exposure with `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`
  - Jaeger distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry integration
  - Docker Compose integration with Prometheus and Jaeger services
  - Comprehensive end-to-end testing script for validation

- **Configuration Updates:**
  - Added MessageBrokerSettings to centralized configuration
  - Added Jaeger host/port settings to NetworkSettings configuration
  - Created centralized logging and tracing configuration modules
  - All services properly configured for observability in Docker environment

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Phase 2: Production Readiness:**
    -   ✅ ~~**Implement Observability Stack**~~ **COMPLETED**
    -   ✅ ~~**Decouple with Message Broker**~~ **COMPLETED** - RabbitMQ fully integrated
    -   **Standardize Database & Security:** Adopt an `alembic upgrade head` deployment step and add standard security headers via API Gateway middleware.
2.  **Performance Benchmarking:**
    -   Conduct a comprehensive performance benchmark to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
    -   Compare latency, throughput, and resource utilization against the previous Python-based system.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Once the core agents are ported, a performance benchmark should be conducted to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Further work is needed to enhance error handling and resilience in the communication between the Python and Rust services.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensure that the ported Rust agents have full feature parity with the original Python implementations.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Rust Dependencies:** `actix-web` is used for the web server, `serde` for serialization, `async-trait` for the agent trait, and `lapin` for RabbitMQ integration.
- **Configuration:** The Orchestration Service uses a `RUST_CORE_URL` environment variable to locate the Rust service.
- **Code Structure:** The new Rust code is organized into `agents`, `types`, and `utils` modules within the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ handles asynchronous task distribution with durable queues for reliability.
