# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

The project has successfully completed **Phase 2 (Pseudocode - Minimum Viable Product)** and is now actively progressing through **Phase 3 (Refinement - Core Features)**. 

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** Two major steps of Phase 3 have been completed with the successful implementation of both the **Functional-Negative-Agent** and **Functional-Stateful-Agent**.

The immediate focus is now on continuing Phase 3 implementation with the final step: **Enhanced Reporting UI** with detailed failure analysis.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Phase 3 Major Progress:** Successfully implemented both the **Functional-Negative-Agent** and **Functional-Stateful-Agent**.
- **Functional-Negative-Agent Features:**
  - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):** Deterministic testing of numeric, string, and array constraints
  - **Creative Invalid Data Generation:** LLM-inspired techniques for wrong data types, missing fields, and semantic violations
  - **Structural Malformation Testing:** Malformed JSON, wrong content types, and empty requests
  - **Comprehensive Error Validation:** Tests for 4xx error responses with proper assertion handling
- **Functional-Stateful-Agent Features:**
  - **Semantic Operation Dependency Graph (SODG):** Intelligent analysis of API operations to identify dependencies
  - **Multi-Step Workflow Support:** CRUD lifecycles, parent-child relationships, and filtered queries
  - **State Management:** Extract/inject rules for passing data between API calls
  - **Workflow Pattern Recognition:** Automatic identification of common API usage patterns
- **Orchestration Service Integration:** Updated the orchestration service to support all three agent types with proper tagging
- **Phase 3 Demo Script:** Created `demo_phase3.py` to demonstrate the advanced negative testing capabilities
- **Enhanced API Specifications:** Developed comprehensive test specifications with constraints for better testing demonstrations

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next steps will complete Phase 3 implementation:

1.  **Enhanced Reporting UI (Final Phase 3 Step):**
    - Create a simple web interface for viewing test results and run history
    - Implement detailed failure analysis views with negative and stateful test insights
    - Add test case categorization and filtering by agent type

2.  **Enhanced Test Execution:**
    - Improve the test execution engine with better assertion validation for negative tests
    - Add support for stateful test execution with state management
    - Enhance error response analysis and reporting

3.  **Phase 4 Preparation:**
    - Begin planning for security and performance agent implementation
    - Research integration patterns for advanced testing capabilities

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Negative Testing Success:** The hybrid approach of deterministic BVA + creative LLM-inspired techniques is working effectively and generating comprehensive negative test suites.
- **Agent Architecture:** The modular agent architecture is proving scalable and maintainable for adding new testing capabilities.
- **Frontend Framework Choice:** The specification allows for React or Vue.js. **Defaulting to React** for now due to its large ecosystem and talent pool, but this can be revisited.
- **LLM Provider:** An initial LLM provider needs to be selected for development and testing. OpenAI is a strong candidate due to its robust API and function-calling capabilities.
- **`ruv-swarm` Integration:** Research and planning for the `ruv-swarm` CLI or library integration need to begin. This will be a critical dependency for the Agent Orchestration Service.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Agent Integration Pattern:** Successfully established the pattern for integrating new agents into the orchestration service
- **Test Case Tagging:** Implemented proper tagging system to distinguish between positive and negative test cases
- **Error Response Handling:** Enhanced the platform's ability to validate and report on expected error responses
- **Demonstration Capabilities:** Created comprehensive demo scripts that showcase the platform's evolving capabilities
