# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

**ðŸš€ PLATFORM EVOLUTION: PHASE 1 COMPLETE!** The `ruv-swarm` integration and agentic core refinement are finished. The project is now ready for Phase 2.

âœ… **Phase 1: `ruv-swarm` Integration & Core Refinement (COMPLETE):**
  - âœ… **`sentinel-rust-core` Service Created:** A new Rust-based microservice now serves as the high-performance agentic core.
  - âœ… **Python Agents Ported to Rust:** Core agent logic has been successfully migrated to Rust, leveraging the `ruv-swarm` framework.
  - âœ… **Orchestration Service Updated:** The Python backend is now fully decoupled from agent implementation, delegating tasks to the Rust core.
  - âœ… **Docker Environment Stabilized:** All services, including the new Rust core, are stable and integrated within the Docker environment.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Architectural Shift:** The agentic layer has been successfully migrated from a Python prototype to a production-grade Rust implementation using `ruv-swarm`.
- **Decoupled Architecture:** The Orchestration Service now acts as a high-level task manager, fully decoupled from the agent implementation details. This allows the agentic system to be scaled and updated independently.
- **Hybrid Model Deprecated:** The temporary hybrid execution model has been removed in favor of the full Rust implementation for all core agents.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Phase 2 Kick-off: Enhance Production Readiness & Observability:**
    -   **Implement Observability Stack:** Introduce structured logging (JSON), correlation IDs, Prometheus for metrics, and Jaeger for distributed tracing.
    -   **Decouple with Message Broker:** Integrate RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between the Orchestration Service and the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
    -   **Standardize Database & Security:** Adopt an `alembic upgrade head` deployment step and add standard security headers via API Gateway middleware.
2.  **Performance Benchmarking:**
    -   Conduct a comprehensive performance benchmark to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
    -   Compare latency, throughput, and resource utilization against the previous Python-based system.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Once the core agents are ported, a performance benchmark should be conducted to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Further work is needed to enhance error handling and resilience in the communication between the Python and Rust services.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensure that the ported Rust agents have full feature parity with the original Python implementations.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Rust Dependencies:** `actix-web` is used for the web server, `serde` for serialization, and `async-trait` for the agent trait.
- **Configuration:** The Orchestration Service uses a `RUST_CORE_URL` environment variable to locate the Rust service.
- **Code Structure:** The new Rust code is organized into `agents`, `types`, and `utils` modules within the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
