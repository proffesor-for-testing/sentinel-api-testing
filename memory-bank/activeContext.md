# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

**ðŸš€ PLATFORM EVOLUTION: PHASE 2 IN PROGRESS!** The observability stack has been successfully implemented. The platform now has comprehensive monitoring and tracing capabilities.

âœ… **Phase 1: `ruv-swarm` Integration & Core Refinement (COMPLETE):**
  - âœ… **`sentinel-rust-core` Service Created:** A new Rust-based microservice now serves as the high-performance agentic core.
  - âœ… **Python Agents Ported to Rust:** Core agent logic has been successfully migrated to Rust, leveraging the `ruv-swarm` framework.
  - âœ… **Orchestration Service Updated:** The Python backend is now fully decoupled from agent implementation, delegating tasks to the Rust core.
  - âœ… **Docker Environment Stabilized:** All services, including the new Rust core, are stable and integrated within the Docker environment.

âœ… **Phase 2: Production Readiness (COMPLETE):**
  - âœ… **Observability Stack Implemented:** Complete observability solution with structured logging (structlog), correlation ID tracking, Prometheus metrics, and Jaeger distributed tracing.
  - âœ… **Message Broker Integration:** COMPLETED - RabbitMQ integrated for asynchronous communication with durable queues.
  - âœ… **Database & Security Standardization:** COMPLETED - Adopted Alembic for database migrations and added standard security headers to the API Gateway.

âœ… **Phase 3: Frontend & Community (COMPLETE):**
  - âœ… **Build Open-Source Community:** **COMPLETED** - Created `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and issue/PR templates.
  - âœ… **Modernize Frontend Architecture:** **COMPLETED** - Adopted Redux Toolkit, React Query, and a BFF endpoint.
  - âœ… **Complete Authentication System:** **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive JWT-based authentication with React frontend, login page, route protection, Redux state management, and user session handling.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Frontend Authentication System Complete:** Comprehensive JWT-based authentication implemented:
  - **Login Page Component:** Complete React login form with validation, password visibility toggle, and demo credentials button
  - **Route Protection:** PrivateRoute component that redirects unauthenticated users to login
  - **Redux State Management:** Auth slice with login/logout actions, token storage, and error handling
  - **API Integration:** Login endpoint properly connected through API Gateway with token handling
  - **User Session Management:** Token persistence in localStorage with automatic cleanup on logout
  - **User Interface:** User menu in layout with profile access and logout functionality
  - **Security Features:** JWT token storage, bearer authentication headers, and CORS configuration

- **Message Broker Integration Complete:** RabbitMQ successfully integrated:
  - RabbitMQ added to Docker Compose infrastructure
  - Message broker configuration added to centralized settings
  - Publisher implementation in Orchestration Service (`broker.py`)
  - Consumer implementation in Sentinel Rust Core with retry logic
  - Fixed type compatibility issues (spec_id: i32 â†’ String)
  - Comprehensive test suite validates end-to-end message flow
  - Durable queues ensure message persistence across restarts

- **Observability Implementation Complete:** All Python services now have:
  - Structured JSON logging with `structlog` for better log aggregation and analysis
  - Correlation ID middleware for request tracking across services
  - Prometheus metrics exposure with `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`
  - Jaeger distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry integration
  - Docker Compose integration with Prometheus and Jaeger services
  - Comprehensive end-to-end testing script for validation

- **Configuration Updates:**
  - Added MessageBrokerSettings to centralized configuration
  - Added Jaeger host/port settings to NetworkSettings configuration
  - Created centralized logging and tracing configuration modules
  - All services properly configured for observability in Docker environment

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Platform Evolution - Next Phase:**
    -   âœ… **Phase 3: Frontend & Community:** **COMPLETED**
        - âœ… Built Open-Source Community with comprehensive guidelines
        - âœ… Modernized Frontend Architecture with Redux Toolkit and React Query  
        - âœ… Implemented Complete Authentication System with JWT and React UI
    -   **Performance Benchmarking:**
        - Conduct comprehensive performance benchmark to quantify Rust implementation improvements
        - Compare latency, throughput, and resource utilization against previous Python-based system
2.  **Production Readiness Final Steps:**
    -   Load testing and performance optimization
    -   Security audit and penetration testing
    -   Disaster recovery planning and testing
    -   Production deployment runbook and automation
3.  **Platform Enhancements:**
    -   Advanced user management features (password reset, user invitations)
    -   Enhanced role-based permissions with granular controls
    -   Real-time notifications and dashboard updates
    -   API rate limiting and advanced security features

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Once the core agents are ported, a performance benchmark should be conducted to quantify the improvements gained from the Rust implementation.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Further work is needed to enhance error handling and resilience in the communication between the Python and Rust services.
- **Feature Parity:** Ensure that the ported Rust agents have full feature parity with the original Python implementations.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

- **Rust Dependencies:** `actix-web` is used for the web server, `serde` for serialization, `async-trait` for the agent trait, and `lapin` for RabbitMQ integration.
- **Configuration:** The Orchestration Service uses a `RUST_CORE_URL` environment variable to locate the Rust service.
- **Code Structure:** The new Rust code is organized into `agents`, `types`, and `utils` modules within the `sentinel-rust-core` service.
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ handles asynchronous task distribution with durable queues for reliability.
