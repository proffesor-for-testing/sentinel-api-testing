# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

The project is currently in **Phase 1 (Specification & Architecture - MVP Foundation)**. The immediate focus is on establishing the core architectural components and foundational data models necessary to support the entire platform.

The primary goal of this phase is to build a stable backbone upon which all future agentic capabilities can be layered.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Project Initialization:** The project has been formally initiated.
- **Documentation Scaffolding:** The core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created based on the initial "Architecting the Sentinel" specification.
- **Directory Structure:** The initial `memory-bank` directory has been created within the `Agents for API testing` project folder.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next steps will focus on completing the project scaffolding and then moving into the initial implementation tasks of Phase 1.

1.  **Complete Documentation:**
    - Create `agent-specifications.md` to detail the behavior of each agent.
    - Create `database-schema.md` to define the PostgreSQL database structure.
    - Create `api-design.md` to outline the internal REST APIs for the platform's services.
    - Create the initial `.clinerules` file.

2.  **Establish Project Structure:**
    - Create the main directories for the backend services (`api_gateway`, `spec_service`, `orchestration_service`, `execution_service`, `data_service`).
    - Create the initial `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the services and the PostgreSQL database.
    - Initialize a `pyproject.toml` for managing Python dependencies.

3.  **Begin Phase 1 Implementation:**
    - **Specification Service:** Implement the initial API specification parser using `prance` and `openapi-core`.
    - **Data & Analytics Service:** Implement the basic database connection and the models for `api_specifications`.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Frontend Framework Choice:** The specification allows for React or Vue.js. A final decision needs to be made. **Defaulting to React** for now due to its large ecosystem and talent pool, but this can be revisited.
- **LLM Provider:** An initial LLM provider needs to be selected for development and testing. OpenAI is a strong candidate due to its robust API and function-calling capabilities.
- **`ruv-swarm` Integration:** Research and planning for the `ruv-swarm` CLI or library integration need to begin. This will be a critical dependency for the Agent Orchestration Service.
