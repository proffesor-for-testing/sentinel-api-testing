# Active Context: Sentinel Platform

## 1. Current Focus

The project has successfully completed **Phase 2 (Pseudocode - Minimum Viable Product)** and achieved a working end-to-end flow. The platform now demonstrates the complete workflow: ingest spec -> generate simple tests -> run -> see results.

The immediate focus is now on **Phase 3 (Refinement - Core Features)** to expand core testing capabilities with more advanced functional agents.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Phase 2 Completion:** Successfully implemented the complete MVP workflow with working end-to-end functionality.
- **Functional-Positive-Agent:** Implemented a sophisticated agent that generates realistic test cases based on API specifications using schema-based data generation.
- **Test Execution Engine:** Built an HTTP client-based test executor that can run generated tests against target environments and validate responses.
- **API Gateway Integration:** Created a comprehensive API Gateway with a complete end-to-end flow endpoint (`/api/v1/test-complete-flow`) that demonstrates the full platform capabilities.
- **Service Integration:** All services now communicate effectively through REST APIs with proper error handling and logging.

## 3. Next Steps

The immediate next steps will focus on Phase 3 implementation to expand the testing capabilities:

1.  **Implement Advanced Functional Agents:**
    - **Functional-Negative-Agent:** Implement boundary value analysis and LLM-powered creative invalid data generation.
    - **Functional-Stateful-Agent:** Implement the Semantic Operation Dependency Graph (SODG) for multi-step test scenarios.

2.  **Enhance Test Execution:**
    - Improve the test execution engine with better assertion validation.
    - Add support for more complex test scenarios and state management.

3.  **Basic Reporting UI:**
    - Create a simple web interface for viewing test results and run history.
    - Implement detailed failure analysis views.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Frontend Framework Choice:** The specification allows for React or Vue.js. A final decision needs to be made. **Defaulting to React** for now due to its large ecosystem and talent pool, but this can be revisited.
- **LLM Provider:** An initial LLM provider needs to be selected for development and testing. OpenAI is a strong candidate due to its robust API and function-calling capabilities.
- **`ruv-swarm` Integration:** Research and planning for the `ruv-swarm` CLI or library integration need to begin. This will be a critical dependency for the Agent Orchestration Service.
