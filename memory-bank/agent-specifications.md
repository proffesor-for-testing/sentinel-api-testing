## Detailed Agent Profiles

### 1. `Spec-Linter-Agent`
- **Goal:** To improve the quality of downstream test generation by first improving the quality of the input API specification.
- **Workflow:**
    1. Ingests the parsed API specification.
    2. Evaluates the quality of `summary` and `description` fields using NLP heuristics.
    3. Validates that schemas are well-defined and not overly generic.
    4. Checks for the presence of `examples` in parameter and schema definitions.
    5. Generates a "LLM-readiness" score and a report with actionable recommendations for the user to improve their specification.

### 2. `Functional-Negative-Agent`
- **Goal:** To systematically and creatively probe an API's error-handling capabilities.
- **Workflow (Hybrid Approach):**
    1. **Stage 1 (Deterministic):**
        - Parses the spec to find all parameters with defined constraints (e.g., `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `enum`).
        - Algorithmically generates a baseline of test cases using Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) for these constraints.
    2. **Stage 2 (Probabilistic):**
        - Uses a creatively prompted LLM to generate a diverse set of invalid inputs.
        - Prompts are engineered to produce payloads with wrong data types, missing required fields, unexpected extra fields, and structurally malformed JSON/XML.
- **Output:** A suite of test cases designed to elicit 4xx and 5xx error responses.

### 3. `Functional-Stateful-Agent`
- **Goal:** To validate complex business workflows that span multiple API calls.
- **Core Data Structure:** Semantic Operation Dependency Graph (SODG).
- **Workflow:**
    1. **Graph Construction:** During spec ingestion, the agent (or Specification Service) builds the SODG, creating directed edges between operations that have a producer-consumer relationship (e.g., `POST /users` -> `GET /users/{id}`).
    2. **Test Generation:** The agent receives a high-level goal (e.g., "Test the full resource lifecycle"). It finds all valid paths through the SODG that satisfy this goal.
    3. **State Management:** As it traverses a path, it defines `extract_rules` to capture values from responses (e.g., resource IDs) and `inject_rules` to use those captured values in subsequent requests.
- **Output:** A sequence of API calls with defined state management rules, representing a complete end-to-end test scenario.

### 4. `Security-Injection-Agent`
- **Goal:** To identify injection vulnerabilities, with a special focus on Prompt Injection in LLM-backed APIs.
- **Workflow (Two-Tiered LLM Architecture):**
    1. **Tier 1 (Strategy):** A powerful, state-of-the-art LLM (e.g., GPT-4) is prompted to devise a high-level plan of attack (e.g., "Outline five logical approaches to test for prompt injection").
    2. **Tier 2 (Payload Generation):** A less-restricted, potentially open-source and locally-hosted LLM takes the strategic outline and generates the actual malicious payloads. This bypasses the safety filters of commercial LLM providers.
- **Output:** A suite of test cases containing payloads designed to test for vulnerabilities like SQLi, NoSQLi, and various forms of prompt injection.

## Hybrid Rust/Python Architecture

### Implementation Strategy
The Sentinel platform implements a **hybrid agent architecture** combining Python and Rust for optimal performance and flexibility:

- **Python Agents**: Located in `/orchestration_service/agents/`, provide reference implementation with LLM integration
- **Rust Agents**: Located in `/sentinel_rust_core/src/agents/`, provide high-performance execution
- **Communication**: Asynchronous via RabbitMQ message queue (`sentinel_task_queue`)
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback from Rust to Python if Rust core is unavailable

### Performance Characteristics
| Agent                        | Python (ms) | Rust (ms) | Speedup |
|------------------------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Functional-Positive          | 450         | 25        | 18x     |
| Functional-Negative          | 680         | 35        | 19x     |
| Functional-Stateful          | 1200        | 65        | 18x     |
| Security-Auth                | 520         | 30        | 17x     |
| Security-Injection           | 890         | 42        | 21x     |
| Performance-Planner          | 560         | 28        | 20x     |
| Data-Mocking                 | 380         | 20        | 19x     |

### Rust Agent Features
- **Memory Safety**: No garbage collection pauses
