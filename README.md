# Sentinel - AI Agentic API Testing Platform

Sentinel is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed to automate the entire API testing lifecycle. It leverages a modular, microservices-inspired architecture and an ecosystem of specialized, ephemeral AI agents to provide comprehensive, intelligent, and efficient testing across functional, security, and performance domains.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The platform is built upon the **ruv-FANN** and **ruv-swarm** frameworks, enabling a paradigm of "ephemeral swarm intelligence" where lightweight, WASM-based agents are dynamically spawned to perform specific testing tasks and dissolved upon completion.

### Core Services

- **API Gateway** (Port 8000): Single entry point for all user interactions
- **Specification Service** (Port 8001): Manages API specification ingestion and parsing
- **Orchestration Service** (Port 8002): Central brain managing agentic workflows
- **Execution Service** (Port 8003): Handles test execution and scheduling
- **Data & Analytics Service** (Port 8004): Manages data persistence and analytics
- **PostgreSQL Database** (Port 5432): Data storage with pgvector extension

## 🤖 Specialized Agents

The platform employs a workforce of specialized AI agents:

- **Spec-Linter-Agent**: Analyzes API specs for "LLM-readiness"
- **Functional-Positive-Agent**: Generates valid, "happy path" test cases
- **Functional-Negative-Agent**: Creates boundary and error condition tests
- **Functional-Stateful-Agent**: Builds complex multi-step workflows
- **Security-Auth-Agent**: Tests authentication/authorization vulnerabilities
- **Security-Injection-Agent**: Probes for injection attacks (including prompt injection)
- **Performance-Planner-Agent**: Generates performance test plans
- **Performance-Analyzer-Agent**: Analyzes performance test results

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+ (for local development)
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Running the Platform

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd "Agents for API testing/sentinel_backend"
   ```

2. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the services:**
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8000
   - Specification Service: http://localhost:8001
   - Orchestration Service: http://localhost:8002
   - Execution Service: http://localhost:8003
   - Data & Analytics Service: http://localhost:8004

### API Documentation

Once running, you can access the interactive API documentation:
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Each service also exposes its own `/docs` endpoint
